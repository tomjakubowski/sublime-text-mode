# sublime-text-mode

A care package for those erstwhile Sublime Text users who miss nag screens.

To enable `sublime-text-mode` globally:

    M-x sublime-text-mode

When `sublime-text-mode` is enabled, every so often, upon saving a buffer,
you'll be presented with a nag screen, just like in Sublime Text.

If you really like nag screens, you might want to add this line to
your `~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d/init.el` or other Emacs startup file:

    (sublime-text-mode)

This will enable sublime-text-mode every time you run Emacs.

To disable `sublime-text-mode`, run `M-x sublime-text-mode` again.
